                        <p>SpaceX aborted the launch of a batch of Starlink internet satellites 18 seconds before blastoff due to an anomalous ground-sensor reading this morning (Oct. 1) at the launchpad in Florida.

                        The company has not yet announced when the next launch opportunity for the rocket will occur. SpaceX has a second Falcon 9 rocket on a neighboring launchpad that is preparing to launch a new GPS satellite on Friday morning (Oct. 2).
                        
                        "The purpose of countdown is to help us catch potential issues prior to flight," Siva Bharadvaj, a spacecraft operator at SpaceX, said after announcing the abort. "There's a thousand ways that a launch can go wrong and only one way it can go right."</p>
                        <p>Despite the ground-sensor reading, Bharadvaj said, the rocket seemed to be in fine condition. "Overall, the vehicle does appear to be in good health," he said.

                            Whenever it does launch, this mission will deliver the 13th batch of about 60 Starlink satellites into orbit to join SpaceX's growing megaconstellation that is designed to provide internet services, particularly in remote areas that are not currently well connected.
                            
                            Before this morning's abort, the launch had been delayed by two weeks by bad weather.</p>

                    <p>International space projects in robotics, disaster relief and space debris could be among the new pioneering collaborations backed by £5 million of new Government funding</p>
                    <p>Through the Government’s new domestic space fund, the National Space Innovation Programme, the UK Space Agency will fund innovative technologies and services to support UK trade, science, and security with major space players like Australia, France, Japan and the United States.

                        Funding – from £250,000 to £2.5 million - will be given to the best international collaborative projects from UK industry, academia and research organisations.</p>
                <p>The UK Space Agency also runs its successful International Partnership Programme (IPP), a £30 million a year programme, which has grant-funded 43 projects in almost 50 developing countries across Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and built new partnerships between 186 mainly UK-based organisations and 183 international organisations.

                    The UK space sector is a huge economic success story, growing by over 60% since 2010. The industry already supports £300 billion of UK economic activity through the use of satellite services, and employs more than 40,000 people. There are further opportunities, with the space sector estimating a £60 billion future market in new Earth observation and communication technologies.
                    
                    Stronger international relationships and the ability to fund new projects are crucial to meeting the Government’s increased ambitions for space. New funding will help boost UK space exports, which are already worth £5.5 billion each year, in areas such as satellite platforms, sensing systems and advanced software.
                    
                    The UK also remains a leading member of the European Space Agency, which is independent of the EU.</p>

            <h5>The Harvest Moon of 2020 rises tonight! But why is it in October?</h5>

                        <p>When the full moon shines tonight (Oct. 1), it will mark the Harvest Moon of 2020. 

                        If it seems a bit late to you, you're not alone. Each year, the full moon that occurs nearest to the autumnal equinox and is thus christened the Harvest Moon. Usually this title goes to the September full moon. There are other versions of this rule that classify the Harvest Moon as the full moon that comes either at or just after the equinox, which, more-often-than-not, would also put it in October. But in the years between 1970 and 2050, the Harvest Moon falls in October no less than 17 times, and 2020 just happens to be one of those years. 
                        
                        While the average occurrence of an October Harvest Moon is once every three years, sometimes as much as eight years can pass between such cases. In fact, the next time we will see a Harvest Moon in October will be in 2028. </p>
                        <p>Some skywatchers may think that the Harvest Moon remains in the night sky longer than any of the other full moons we see during the year, but that's not the case. What sets tonight's full moon apart from the others throughout the year is that farmers at the peak of the current harvest season can work late into the night by the brilliant moonlight. 

                        Tonight, the moon rises at about the same time as the sun sets. More importantly, at this time of year, instead of rising its normal average 50 minutes later each day, the moon appears to rise at nearly the same time each night. In actuality, over the next few nights, the rising of the moon as seen from mid-northern latitudes will come, on average, roughly 24 minutes later each night. The reason for this seasonal circumstance is that the moon appears to move along the ecliptic and at this time of year when rising, the ecliptic makes its smallest angle with respect to the horizon.</p>
                        <p>Occurring on the first October, also means that the Harvest moon will be the first of two full moons this month. The second full moon comes on Halloween (Oct. 31) and will be christened the "Blue Moon." </p>

                    <p>American astronauts will vote from space in the upcoming presidential election after launching to the International Space Station aboard a historic SpaceX mission for NASA.</p>
                    <p>This Halloween (Oct. 31), astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker will launch to the space station alongside Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi as part of SpaceX's Crew-1 mission — the first operational flight of the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft for NASA. And, in addition to their many duties on the orbiting lab, the American astronauts will vote in the 2020 presidential election. 

                        "All of us are planning on voting from space," Walker told reporters in a news conference today (Sept. 29) about the NASA astronauts headed to the space station. "NASA works very well with different election organizations because we're all voting from different counties. But it was easiest for us just to say we are going to vote from space. So that's what we're going to do." </p>
                <p>So, how does one vote from space? Walker said it's fairly simple. 

                    "I can talk about casting a ballot from space since I did it last time I was on the space station," she said. "They basically send you an electronic file, it's a PDF, and you mark your choices. And then you email it back to … the person who's in charge of the election for the county [you vote in]. And so then that gets counted into all the ballots that are brought back. It's very simple, very straightforward."
                    
                    NASA's Mission Control helps to send that file to the crew and then send the ballots off to the astronauts' respective county clerks to be counted. This is not the first time that astronauts have voted from space, as it is a fairly regular occurrence when astronauts have been on the space station during an election. In November, the International Space Station will mark 20 years of continuous crewed missions, so finding a way for astronauts to vote was something NASA faced early on.</p>
