//BASIC INFORMATION

Website Development Roadmap:
1. Front-end 
2. Back-end

Together known as Full-Stack.


1. Front-end:
   Tools you need:
       1.*HTML* (HTML5 tbp)
       2.*CSS* (CSS3 tbp)
       3.*JavaScript* (We can either learn this or *Typescript*, which is a superset of JS, but there is varied opinion on whether you should start with Typescript or Javascript as a beginner)
       4.*Git* (We need to know Git since we need version control in our Project, meaning we integrate features on a base version and keep doing that and store each version along the way on git hub)
       5.Obviously we need a text/code editor like *VScode* (lets stick to VCcode to have uniformity, since Anurag and Ria have it).

2. Back-end:
   Tools you need:
       1.React.
       2.MongoDb or other database.
